function DispMap=stereoDisparity(E,image1, image2, halfBolcksize, disparityRange ,false)

% The following code was adapted from a Mathworks example available here:
% http://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/stereo-vision.html
%
% This script will compute the disparity map for the image 'right.png' by
% correlating it to 'left.png' using basic block matching and sub-pixel
% estimation. This code corresponds to sections 1 - 3 of the Mathworks 
% tutorial. 
%
% The main differences with the original tutorial are the following:
%   - Removed dependency on the TemplateMatcher object.
%   - Syntax and variable name changes for clarity.
%   - Extensive commenting.

%       Display Composite Image
% ===================================
% This code will display the left image as a red image and the right image as a
% cyan image on top of one another. You can view the resulting image with red /
% blue glasses to see it in 3D.

% Create a composite image out of the two stereo images.
leftRed = left(:,:,1);

% Take the green and blue color channels from the right image.
rightGreenBlue = right(:,:,2:3);

% Combine the above channels into a single composite image using the 'cat' 
% function, which concatenates the matrices along dimension '3'.
composite = cat(3, leftRed, rightGreenBlue);

% Show the composite image.

%        Basic Block Matching
% ====================================
% Calculate the disparity using basic block matching with sub-pixel
% estimation.
% The original Mathworks example code utilized the TemplateMatcher from their
% vision toolbox; I've modified the code to work without this dependency.

% Start a timer.
tic();

% Convert the images from RGB to grayscale by averaging the three color 
% channels.
leftI = mean(left, 3);
rightI = mean(right, 3);

% DbasicSubpixel will hold the result of the block matching. 
% The values will be 'single' precision (32-bit) floating point.
DbasicSubpixel = zeros(size(leftI), 'single');

% The disparity range defines how many pixels away from the block's location
% in the first image to search for a matching block in the other image.
% 50 appears to be a good value for the 450x375 images from the "Cones" 
% dataset.
disparityRange = 50;

% Define the size of the blocks for block matching.
halfBlockSize =3;
blockSize = 2 * halfBlockSize + 1;

% Get the image dimensions.

% For each row 'm' of pixels in the image...
for (m = 1 : imgHeight)
    	
	% Set min/max row bounds for the template and blocks.
	% e.g., for the first row, minr = 1 and maxr = 4
    minr = max(1, m - halfBlockSize);
    maxr = min(imgHeight, m + halfBlockSize);
	
    % For each column 'n' of pixels in the image...
    for (n = 1 : imgWidth)
        
		% Set the min/max column bounds for the template.
		% e.g., for the first column, minc = 1 and maxc = 4
		minc = max(1, n - halfBlockSize);
        maxc = min(imgWidth, n + halfBlockSize);
        
		% Define the search boundaries as offsets from the template location.
		% Limit the search so that we don't go outside of the image. 
		% 'mind' is the the maximum number of pixels we can search to the left.
		% 'maxd' is the maximum number of pixels we can search to the right.
		%
		% In the "Cones" dataset, we only need to search to the right, so mind
		% is 0.
		%
		% For other images which require searching in both directions, set mind
		% as follows:
           mind = max(-disparityRange, 1 - minc);
		%mind = 0; 
        maxd = min(disparityRange, imgWidth - maxc);

		% Select the block from the right image to use as the template.

		% Get the number of blocks in this search.
		numBlocks = maxd - mind + 1;
		
		% Create a vector to hold the block differences.
		blockDiffs = zeros(numBlocks, 1);
        
        
		
		% Calculate the difference between the template and each of the blocks.

			% Compute the 1-based index of this block into the 'blockDiffs' vector.
			blockIndex = i - mind + 1;
		
			% Take the sum of absolute differences (SAD) between the template
			% and the block and store the resulting value.
			blockDiffs(blockIndex, 1) = sum(sum(abs(template - block)));
		end
		
		% Sort the SAD values to find the closest match (smallest difference).
		% Discard the sorted vector (the "~" notation), we just want the list
		% of indices.
		[temp, sortedIndeces] = sort(blockDiffs);
		
		% Get the 1-based index of the closest-matching block.
		bestMatchIndex = sortedIndeces(1, 1);
		
		% Convert the 1-based index of this block back into an offset.
		% This is the final disparity value produced by basic block matching.
		d = bestMatchIndex + mind - 1;
			
		% Calculate a sub-pixel estimate of the disparity by interpolating.
		% Sub-pixel estimation requires a block to the left and right, so we 
		% skip it if the best matching block is at either edge of the search
		% window.
		if ((bestMatchIndex == 1) || (bestMatchIndex == numBlocks))
			% Skip sub-pixel estimation and store the initial disparity value.
			DbasicSubpixel(m, n) = d;
		else
			% Grab the SAD values at the closest matching block (C2) and it's 
			% immediate neighbors (C1 and C3).
			C1 = blockDiffs(bestMatchIndex - 1);
			C2 = blockDiffs(bestMatchIndex);
			C3 = blockDiffs(bestMatchIndex + 1);

			% We're estimating the subpixel location of the true best match.
